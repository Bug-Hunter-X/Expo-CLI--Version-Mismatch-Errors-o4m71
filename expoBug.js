This error typically arises when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the dependencies specified in your project's `package.json`.  Specifically, the `expo` package itself, or other packages that rely on Expo's internal modules, might be incompatible with the version of the CLI you're running.  This can manifest in various ways, including unexpected behavior during builds or crashes during runtime. For example, a recent update to a library that you have in your project may require a newer version of Expo, while your CLI might be outdated.
