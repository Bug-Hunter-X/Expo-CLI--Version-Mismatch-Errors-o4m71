The solution involves ensuring compatibility between your Expo CLI and the packages in your `package.json`. Here's how you can address the issue:

**1. Update Expo CLI:**

   Open your terminal and run `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` or `yarn global add expo-cli@latest` to upgrade your Expo CLI to the latest version.

**2. Update/Adjust Project Dependencies:**

   Examine your `package.json`. Check the versions of `expo` and any related packages.  Look for compatibility notes in the release notes of the updated libraries that caused the error.  You may need to update these dependencies to match the capabilities of your Expo CLI version.  You can do this using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` (or using specific version numbers for precision).

**3. Check Expo SDK Version:**

   Your Expo SDK version should also be compatible.  Check the Expo documentation for compatibility guidelines between the CLI and the SDK version.  If necessary, update the SDK version in your `app.json` or `expo.json` file.

**4. Clean and Rebuild:**

   After making changes, run `expo start --clear` to ensure a clean rebuild of your project.  If using Android, ensure that your Android environment is clean.  Remove old builds and caches.
